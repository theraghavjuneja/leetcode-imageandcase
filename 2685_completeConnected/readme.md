### Counting Complete Connected Components

#### Understanding the Problem
- The question requires us to **find the number of complete connected components** in an undirected graph.  
- So what exactly is a **Complete Connected Component (CCC)?**  

### Definition of CCC
Let's say we have **3 nodes: A, B, and C**  
- If:  
  - **A** is connected to **B & C**  
  - **B** is connected to **A & C**  
  - **C** is connected to **A & B**  

Then, this is **a completely connected component** because every node is directly connected to every other node in the component.

### First Approach and Its Failure
#### Initial Thought Process
- My first thought was:
  - Check how many nodes each node is connected to.
  - If all nodes in a component have the **same** number of connections, then it must be **fully connected**.  

#### Why This Fails?  
Consider the test case:

```cpp
edges = [[1,0], [2,0], [3,1], [3,2]]
```

This graph looks like:

```
    0
   / \
  1   2
   \ /
    3
```

**Adjacency List Representation:**  

```
0 â†’ [1, 2]  
1 â†’ [0, 3]  
2 â†’ [0, 3]  
3 â†’ [1, 2]
```

---

### Why Isn't This a Complete Connected Component?  
For it to be **fully connected**,  
- **Node 0** should be connected to **1, 2, and 3**  
- **Node 1** should be connected to **0, 2, and 3**  

But here, every node is missing **one** connection, making it **not a complete connected component.**  

#### Key Observation  
- If a component has **N nodes**, it should have **exactly `N * (N-1) / 2` edges** (since each pair of nodes must be connected).  

---

### Final Approach (Using DFS)
#### Steps to Solve
1. **Use DFS** to traverse each component.  
2. **Count the number of nodes and edges** in the component.  
3. **Check if the component satisfies the formula:**  
   ```
   edges = nodes * (nodes - 1) / 2
   ```
4. If the condition is met, increment the count of complete components.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& ump, vector<bool>& visited, int &nodes, int &edges) {
        visited[node] = true;
        nodes++;  
        for (int neighbor : ump[node]) {
            edges++;  // Counting edges
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, ump, visited, nodes, edges);
            }
        }
    }

    int countCompleteComponents(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> ump;
        int count = 0;

        // Build adjacency list
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            ump[u].push_back(v);
            ump[v].push_back(u);                                                                 
        }

        vector<bool> visited(n, false);  

        // Traverse all nodes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int nodes = 0, edges = 0;
                dfs(i, ump, visited, nodes, edges);

                // Since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph, divide by 2
                if (edges / 2 == nodes * (nodes - 1) / 2) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **DFS Traversal:** `O(N + E)`  
- **Edge Check Condition:** `O(1)`  
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(N + E)`

### Example Test Cases
#### Test Case 1
```cpp
int n = 6;
vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0,1}, {1,2}, {2,0}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,3}};
cout << countCompleteComponents(n, edges);  // Expected Output: 2
```
âœ… **Explanation:** Two complete components exist:  
1. `{0,1,2}` (Triangle)  
2. `{3,4,5}` (Triangle)  

#### Test Case 2
```cpp
int n = 4;
vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0,1}, {1,2}, {2,3}};
cout << countCompleteComponents(n, edges);  // Expected Output: 0
```
âœ… **Explanation:** This is just a linear chain, **not fully connected**.

---

### Final Thoughts
- **Key Insight:** The number of edges in a complete component must satisfy the formula `E = (N * (N-1)) / 2`.  
- **Using DFS**, we count nodes and edges per component and check if they match this formula.  
- This approach ensures we **efficiently** find and count complete connected components. ðŸš€
