#### How to solve Subset DP Problems?
- Subset : contigous/ non-contigous part of array
- so according to notes what I can understand is take- notTake approach
### Most standard question
**Question** :  **Subset sum equal to target**
#### I remember here I will take if current number>=targetRemaining, else i will make a not take call. And return among or between them
#### From this only, other questions formed ki subset sum is target/2. Mostly around subset sum only that get reduced to this question only
